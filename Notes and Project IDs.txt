Project setup
--------------------------------------------------------
Each app is in it's own branch, if a change is ever made in development branch, it must be
merged into all other branches and each one then needs to run the build processes

Each new project / branch will need /app.json changed to reflect the new name in multiple
locations and new project ID (which is gotten from expo, where we first need to create the project)
